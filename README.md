# üìù QuickNotes

A lightweight Flask-based note-taking app, containerized with Docker and ideal for practicing modern DevOps and container deployment workflows.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

**QuickNotes** is a minimal Python web app designed for learners, cloud engineers, and DevOps professionals who want to:

- Build and containerize Flask apps
- Use Docker Compose with secure environment management
- Align with real-world DevOps scenarios
- Build muscle memory for cloud deployment, version control, and container registries

This project reflects hands-on work from concept to container, with a focus on security, efficiency, and repeatable deployments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **Flask** (Lightweight Python web framework)
- **Docker** + **Docker Compose**
- **dotenv** for environment variable management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup (Docker Compose)

### 1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quicknotes.git
cd quicknotes


### 2. Configure Environment Variables


cp .env.example .env

> Update `.env` as needed. Default Flask port is `5000`.

### 3. Run Locally


docker compose up --build

Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## üîê Security Practices

* Secrets are externalized via `.env` and not hardcoded.
* Docker image is lean, exposing only the necessary port (5000 or 5001).
* Follows container isolation best practices.
* Local dev setup isolates dependencies and avoids system conflicts.
