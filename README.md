# üìù QuickNotes

A lightweight Flask-based note-taking app, containerized with Docker and perfect for practicing modern web app deployment.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

**QuickNotes** is a beginner-friendly Python web app designed for learners and DevOps professionals who want to:

- Understand how Flask apps are structured and deployed
- Practice using `docker-compose` with environment variables
- Learn how to manage `.env` files and keep credentials secure
- Lay a foundation for future Azure container deployments

It serves as an ideal hands-on lab for those studying for the **Azure Administrator Associate** certification or exploring real-world DevOps and container security concepts.
